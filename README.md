# MultiClient-Calculator
This program contains a TCP server that will take a simple equation from a client, calculate the answer, and send it back to the client. 
The program uses threading to handle multiple clients at the same time.
Server holds each client's information such as the time when connection is established, the client's name, and the total time spent by the client after exiting.
